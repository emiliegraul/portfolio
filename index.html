          My name is Emilie Graul, and I am a Project Manager and Designer
          working for start-ups in San Francisco. I love making all the pieces
          of the puzzle fit together, and would love to get started with your
          team! Below I’ve outlined some of the highlights of the past few years
          of my career.

          The Colour Studio is a boutique color consultancy working primarily
          with architecture firms in the Bay Area. As Project Manager and Design
          Associate, I was responsible for leading many local and national
          projects.
        </p>

        <p class="main-content">
          I assisted in generating proposals, outlining scope, delegating
          project tasks, and the daily coordination with clients, architects,
          facility managers, developers, contractors, designers, etc.
        </p>

        <p class="main-content">
          One of the highlights of my job was being able to work on the older,
          more ornate buildings of San Francisco. We had more freedom with these
          projects to propose bright and intricate schemes. It’s a pleasure of
          mine to spot building exteriors around the city that I had a hand in
          creating.

            Color was meticulously matched from screen to print to real-life
            application, guaranteeing an accurate portrayal from start to
            finish.

          During my time at Colour Studio I drove many projects to completion,
          including multiple 100+ unit residential projects around San
          Francisco, Oakland, Mountain View, San Diego, and Los Angeles.

            residential neighborhoods, to multi-million dollar renovations like
            that of the USCF campus.

          Hack Reactor is a premier coding bootcamp in San Francisco. During a
          three month program, students are trained as software engineers and
          guided into the industry. As an Operations Associate, I had a

          Constant office upkeep was critical as students and staff would be in
          the space from early morning to late at night. It was important to
          ensure everything was properly cleaned and stocked every day for the
          50+ staff members and 200+ students.

          By the way! I most recently spent 5 months traveling around the world, visiting 12
          different countries. I met some amazing people, stayed in some
          beautiful cities, and ate some delicious food. I learned a lot about
          different cultures, but also about myself in the process. Ask me about
