          Hello! My name is Emilie Graul, and I’m a Project Manager and Designer
          with experience working for creative companies and startups. I enjoy
          seeing a project through from start to finish and developing
          professional relationships along the way. Below I’ve outlined some of
          the highlights of the past few years of my career.

          The Colour Studio is a boutique color consultancy that has operated in
          San Francisco for over forty years. The company works primarily with
          architecture firms and property management companies in California,
          supporting the massive development in the area. As Project Manager and
          Design Associate, I was responsible for leading all ongoing projects

        <p class="main-content">
          My responsibilities at the company included generating proposals,
          outlining scope, delegating project tasks, and maintaining daily
          coordination with clients, designers, architects, developers,
          contractors, et al. I also had a hand in creating and developing
          design choices and presenting them to clients.

        <p class="main-content">
          One of the highlights of my experience there was working with the
          older, more ornately-styled buildings of San Francisco. We enjoyed
          designing bright and intricate schemes for these unique properties.
          It’s now a pleasure of mine to spot building exteriors around the city
          that I had a hand in creating.

          stayed in some beautiful cities, and ate some delicious food. I
          learned a lot about different cultures, but also about myself in the
          process. Ask me about it!
